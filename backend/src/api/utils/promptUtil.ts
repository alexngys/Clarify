        Title: Clarity to Solidity Code Conversion

        Description: 
        Convert the provided Clarity smart contract code to its equivalent in Solidity, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent across both versions. Translate the logic, functions, and data structures from Clarity to Solidity while preserving the original intent and behavior of the contract.
        Call the solidity contract "ClarityEquivalent", and use the solidity compiler version 0.8.21

        \`\`\`

        Instructions:
        1. Identify and translate data types from Clarity to their Solidity counterparts.
        2. Convert Clarity functions to Solidity functions, ensuring that visibility and mutability are appropriately set.
        3. Translate any contract storage variables and structures, preserving their relationships and accessibility.
        4. Ensure that any contract-level logic is preserved and functional in the Solidity version.
        5. Comment on any significant differences or considerations that arise from translating between these two smart contract languages.
        6. Provide a brief explanation for each function's purpose and any modifications made during translation.
